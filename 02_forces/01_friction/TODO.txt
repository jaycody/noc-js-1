this.TODO:
[x] create a Surface class which exerts FRICTION FORCE
[x] when vehicle isOn surface, draw a secondary vehicle depicting the surface location



___________________________________________
next.TODO:
[ ] vehicle's perlin steering force should have initial seed unique to vehicle, vs.... 
[ ] but external perlin force should be a uniform perlin force across all vehicles 

[ ] create an External class which exerts external global forces across all vehicles
[ ] External forces include perlin and random forces, wind, global gravity (not located in an attractor)

[ ] create a Fluid class which exerts DRAG FORCE
[ ] create an Attractor field which exerts Gravity from an attractor location

___________________________________________
ongoing.TODO:
[ ] add symlink to p5.js library from each new project
[ ] add RESET for mouseClick
[ ] overload the constructor such that objects can be created with or without arguments
[ ] add room below the canvase for sliders. reduce the canvas height to .8 * INNER_HEIGHT
[ ] add sliders to control External Forces, Steering Forces, Vehicle attributes, Surface and Fluid attributes, Attractors

archived.TODO:
[x] create the vehicle class and display the vehicle
[x] create a todo.txt page
